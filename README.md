# randomBeastie
Picks a random name from a list in a text file

## To use
Clone, list candidates in beasties.txt and run the main file with
> node randomBeastie.js

One of the candidates is selected at random, and the name displayed after a [Beastie Job](https://freelancer.beastiejob.com/) inspired text dance.

It works on windows using node. But may not work everywhere since it uses stdout.curserTo()
